# SPECTRA - SOLID PROPELLANT ENGINE CHARATERIZATION & TEST RIG FOR AEROSPACE

SPECTRA is a Solid Propellant Model Rocket Motor Test Stand designed by Spark Tech. This project aims to create a testing platform for model rocket motor, allowing researchers and hobbyists to analyze and test solid propellant rocket motor in a safe and controlled environment.

## FEATUTRS:

- Programmable logic controller (PLC) based control system (Arduino Nano board)
- Load cell andDual-channel 24-bit precision A/D weight pressure sensor (HX711)
- SevSeg display for countdown display
- Data logging to SD card
- Nichrome wire for igniting the motor (IRF540N MOSFET)
- Open-source design and analysis

## COMPONENTS:

SPECTRA consists of various components,PLC-based control system, load cell and HX711 sensor, SevSeg display, SD card for data logging and nichrome wire for igniting the motor. The PLC-based control system allows for precise and automated control of the testing process, including thrust measurement and ignition.

The load cell and HX711 sensor are used to measure the thrust produced by the rocket motor. The data is also logged to an SD card for further analysis.

## USAGE:

SPECTRA is designed for researchers and hobbyists who want to test and analyze solid propellant rocket engines in a safe and controlled environment. The open-source design and analysis allow for customization and modification to meet individual needs and requirements.

## LICENSE:

SPECTRA is released under the MIT License.
